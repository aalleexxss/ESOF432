## UML Diagram and Design Decisions

## Running Software
To run the software you're going to need to use `adonis serve --dev` when in the directory with our AdonisJS installation.
## Testing the Software
Functional test can be found in ````423commentapi/test/functional````. To run test open a terminal and run ````adonis test````.
## Automated Build and Test
We do not think that this is very applicable to our project but could be mistaken.
## Releasing a Version
To create a new release one must first upload a verison of the code with a tag of the version that they are planning on releasing. Then you can follow this tutorial to create a release on Github [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository#creating-a-release).
## Accessing Bugs
Bugs will be created as an issue on this Github repository. You can also find it [here](https://github.com/aalleexxss/ESOF432/issues).
## Commenting Code
Please try to comment your code so it is easy for others to follow and see what changes you made.
