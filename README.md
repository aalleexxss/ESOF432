This repository contains an API backend for handling all logic and storage relating to a commenting system. 
The purpose of this API is to enable sites that want users to be able to post comments, reply to other comments,
delete previous comments, edit comments, and like comments to do so. Our API is: 
- Flexible
- Efficient
- Simple while still being functional

Adonis js was used to create this API backend. Adonis is a Node.js framework that is great for building scalable
apps. If you would like to contribute to this project, find more information in our developer documentation
[here](https://github.com/aalleexxss/ESOF432/blob/master/dev-doc.md). If you would like to use this API in a site
of your own, find more information in our user documentation [here](https://github.com/aalleexxss/ESOF432/blob/master/user-doc.md). 
Additionally, a simple frontend is provided in the [comment-frontend](https://github.com/aalleexxss/ESOF432/tree/dev/comment-frontend) 
directory. This frontend was made using react and is meant to be an example on how our backend could be implemented
into a frontend. The full site can be found at [http://acommentapi.com](http://acommentapi.com/).
